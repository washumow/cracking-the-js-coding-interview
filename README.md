# Cracking the JS Coding Interview

These repository will have my own implementation of problems found on books and on the Internet. The purpose of this is to create a Guide that anyone could review in case they want to apply to a company as a **Front End Software Engineer**, this can also help anyone but the main focus and implementation will be on JavaScript.

Please review the Wiki page to learn more about the project, and review the different topics.
